/**
 * Container class for one axis of acceleration data from the BMI160 and BMA255 accelerometers that will always be positive.
 * This can be done either combining the data of all three axes into 1 value via a RMS or RSS computation,
 * or feeding single axis data through an absolute value transformer.  Data by default is interpreted
 * as a float and given in G's.  Interpreting the data as a short, integer, or long will convert the
 * data to milli G's
